# 02-Homework
This assignment relates to CSS and Bootstrap.

This repository is all about me and my interests, and it's also the perfect summation of my coding skills so far. The combination of having a template supplied and also getting to create our own designs was a lot of fun! And who doesn't love to talk about themselves for a while? 

Through this assignment I learned a lot about the magic and beauty of Bootstrap, but my GoogleFu skills were seriously tested. The Portfolio page, specifically, was really tricky for me to figure out. I spent quite a bit of time reading through Bootstrap's website and my own code to try and identify what errors I had made. Ultimately, my trial and error paid off and I have a working webpage that I can be proud of.
